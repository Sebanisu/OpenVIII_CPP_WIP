I'm just trying to see how hard it would be to port some things to cpp. Testing code on gcc and msvc. I'm not sure how far I'm gonna go. 

Trying to stick with Standard Libs for cpp17 and maybe cpp20 when possible. I'm thinking of using Imgui if I get to the point of drawing anything on screen.


I'm inexprenced. I am trying to learn as I go. It might not be correct.
