TODO:
1) improve reswizzle speed.
    a) reduce hard drive reads.
        Currently use lazy reads when needed. But this means I read the same file more than once.
    b) reduce loops over the same data.
        I go over the same data a lot.
    c) I can change the array to instead of grouping by bpp to by texture page id.
9) if 32 bit treat 0 alpha as transparent black (all 0 for color and alpha). requires adding png support.
10) add a test to deswizzle the reswizzled images.
11) add a test to compare the two deswizzled versions and throw if they don't match.
12) test support for scaling.

16bit color conversion could maybe be faster. I need to test it.

mim improvement?
I know some things at compile time. I could a use factory method and templates to define mim with constant size std::array.
Though that is alot of stack size. though the data buffer is already in the heap so this is probably not that useful
