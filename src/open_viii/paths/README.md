This handles the knowing of where FF8 is on the drive. Needs improved. Like I'm thinking a config file to read. And I'd like to add windows.h for msvc only so i
can read from the registry. Maybe also have a function to choose which one to load. Right now for testing I just check listed paths. To make sure the code runs
on all of them.
