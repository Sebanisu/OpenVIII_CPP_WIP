This Library is for handling FI FL FS and ZZZ files in a read only fashion. I may add the ability to write changes back.
Though that is a bit of work. As you have to recreate the containers from scratch and read the elements. Will have the
ability to find files in the archive and extract the one you want. Unsure if we should store the filelist as a vector of
strings. Depends how many times you could go through the files.
