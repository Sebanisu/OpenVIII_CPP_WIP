TODO:
Need to reswizzle output.
0) create new test? or add to extract images?
1) find the images in folder.
2) filter down to the images with the HEX pupu ID.
3) read in hex values using pattern = field_hex_mimmap.ext
4) group the hex values that are the same (depth and same field and same textureID)
5) filter the tiles for the field that match the hex values read in.
6) produce a image that is field_depth_textureID. images will be square 256x256.
7) we copy each tile into the new image. putting it from (x,y) to (src x,y).
8) if 24 bit treat black as transparent. ppm is 24 bit
9) if 32 bit treat 0 alpha as transparent black (all 0 for color and alpha).
