## Images

On all image types, usually, black is 100% transparent.

```{tab} TIM

Pretty much everything else is some variation on 
[Playstation TIM](http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/TIM_(PlayStation_graphics)).
All of these images use [15-bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_color#15-bit_high_color)
1555 (Alpha, Blue, Green, Red) high color. The alpha bit is special on playstation. 
So you might have to ignore it unless the image doesn't look correct. Many files have these embedded into 
them.

```{tab} TEX
[TEX](http://wiki.ffrtt.ru/index.php?title=FF7/TEX_format)

```{tab} PNG
