## Images

On all image types, usually, black is 100% transparent.

### TIM

Pretty much everything else is some variation on [Playstation TIM](http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/TIM_(PlayStation_graphics)). All of these images use 16-bit 1555 (Alpha, Blue, Green, Red) color. The alpha bit is
special on playstation. So you might have to ignore it unless the image doesn't look correct. Many files have these embedded into them.

### TEX

Used in only the PC games for 2x resolution fonts and UI elements.

### PNG

Used in remaster for high-res textures.
